# Build Applications from Website to Mobile - John Chen's Professional Profile

This is the React Native mobile version of the [Build Applications from Website to Mobile - John Chen's Professional Profile](https://projects-jglchen.vercel.app/). To keep the design consistent with the parent website version, Tailwind CSS with NativeWind is adopted for the UI design. **A theme toggling mechanism** is included for users to switch between the light theme and the dark theme. In addition, **a bilingual selection** is provided for the pages, users can freely choose either English or traditional Chinese to view.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the development builds with [iOS Simulator Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/projects-jglchen/builds/05e970e6-dfc6-434a-9a95-a9161b872a1c) and [Android Internal Distribution Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/projects-jglchen/builds/fe31f009-3fa3-4e57-8ecd-be1cfe2fa1e6).
